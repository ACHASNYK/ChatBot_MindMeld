# ChatBot_MindMeld
Its my Training project with Conversational AI chatbot - text intent recognition task

Hi to everyone, this is a very interesting experience - to have a deep dive into Conversational AI framework MindMeld by Cisco. 
My task was to build a model and train it to recognize and classify greeting and exit words in Ukrainian language.
Also to build a bot to Telegram messenger - which will be able to provide and easy communicational channel to this facility.
So far this project was accomplished successfully today - I did a little bonus - I have 2 domains trained instead of one.
Now it can recognize greets in EN and UA languages accordignly.
What about Telegram interface - I have used a simplified version for testing purposes only.
However it works surprisignly well with MM interface.

To install and launch - please refer to MindMeld official documentation, setup guide etc.

+ (beware of MM and its dependancy hard requirements - when it says 4G and 2 CPU - so let it be ))
